# Python Learning Scripts

A curated collection of Python scripts designed for beginners and intermediate learners to grasp various Python concepts. Each script includes detailed comments and explanations.

## How to Use This Repository

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```
2.  **Ensure Python is Installed:** Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you haven't already.
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Some scripts might require external libraries (e.g., `matplotlib`, `requests`, `Pygments`). If you see an `ImportError`, install the required library using pip. The `requirements.txt` file lists dependencies for tools like the HTML index generator.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    ```
    Alternatively, install common ones you might encounter for individual scripts:
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib requests
    ```
4.  **Browse Scripts via HTML Index:**
    Open the `index.html` file (located in the root of this repository) in your web browser for a categorized view of all scripts with syntax highlighting. This is often the easiest way to explore the code. If `index.html` is not present or outdated, you can generate it using the instructions in the 'Generating the HTML Index Page' section below.

5.  **Run Individual Scripts:**
    Most scripts are self-contained. Navigate to the repository's root directory and run them using:
    ```bash
    python script_name.py
    ```
    For example, to run the BMI calculator:
    ```bash
    python "BMI conditional.py"
    ```
    (Note: Some filenames contain spaces. Using quotes around the filename is a good practice if so.)

    For the custom module example, navigate into its directory:
    ```bash
    cd custom_module_example
    python main.py
    cd ..
    ```

## Generating the HTML Index Page

This repository includes a script `generate_html_index.py` that creates an `index.html` file, providing a browsable interface with syntax-highlighted code for all Python scripts.

To generate or update `index.html`:

1.  **Install Dependencies for the Generator:**
    The `generate_html_index.py` script requires the `Pygments` library. Ensure it's installed. You can install all necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` by running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Alternatively, install `Pygments` directly:
    ```bash
    pip install Pygments
    ```
2.  **Run the Generator Script:**
    From the root directory of the repository:
    ```bash
    python generate_html_index.py
    ```
    This will create or overwrite the `index.html` file in the root directory. Open this file in a web browser to view the scripts.
