# Python Scripts Collection

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts written for learning and practice purposes.

## Topics Covered

The scripts in this collection cover a variety of Python concepts, including:

*   Basic Python syntax and operations (e.g., calculations, string manipulation)
*   Conditional statements (`if`/`elif`/`else`)
*   Input and output operations
*   Working with modules (e.g., `math`)
*   Data visualization using `matplotlib`
*   Making HTTP requests with the `requests` library (example provided)
*   Loops (e.g. `while`, `for`) 
*   Error handling
*   Data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries)
*   JSON manipulation

## How to Run the Scripts

1.  **Ensure Python is installed:** If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.  **Clone the repository (optional):** You can clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```
    Alternatively, you can download individual scripts.
3.  **Navigate to the script's directory:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python script is located.
4.  **Run the script:** Execute the script using the Python interpreter:
    ```bash
    python <script_name>.py
    ```
    Replace `<script_name>.py` with the actual name of the script you want to run.

Some scripts might require specific libraries (e.g., `matplotlib`, `requests`). If you encounter an `ImportError`, you may need to install the missing library using pip:
```bash
pip install <library_name>
```
For example:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
pip install requests
```

## Usage and Experimentation

Feel free to use these scripts for learning and practice. You can:

*   Modify them to experiment with different Python features.
*   Extend them with new functionalities.
*   Use them as a reference for your own projects.

Happy coding!
